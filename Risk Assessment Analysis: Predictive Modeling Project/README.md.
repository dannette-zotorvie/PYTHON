### **Risk Assessment Analysis and Predictive Model Development**

This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation related to analyzing credit risk data and building a predictive model to forecast credit risk. 
Below, you'll find details about the contents of this folder and the purpose of the project.

#### **Contents of the Folder**

1. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Filename: `Credit Risk Assessment_.ipynb`  
     This notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of credit risk data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and the development of a predictive model to estimate bike prices.
     Key steps include:  
     - Data cleaning and preparation  
     - Statistical analysis and insights  
     - Building and evaluating a machine learning model  

2. **CSV Dataset**
   - Filename: credit_risk_dataset.csv
     Description:
   - This file contains the dataset used for the analysis and model development. It includes detailed information such as Personal information of loan applicant, Loan details, Credit history and other relevant factors.

#### **Project Objectives**
- Perform an in-depth analysis of credit risk to uncover trends and insights.  
- Develop a predictive model capable of estimating credit risk based on the dataset.  
- Provide actionable insights to stakeholders for better decision-making in the creditors domain.  

#### **Getting Started**
1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Install required libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.  

2. **How to Use:**  
  - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`credit_risk_dataset.csv.zip`) to view the analysis and model-building steps.  
  - Use the CSV file (`credit_risk_dataset.csv.zip`) for data reference or reuse in further analyses.

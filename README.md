### **Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Projects**
This repository houses a collection of data analysis and predictive modeling projects, each located in its own folder. 
Every project includes detailed documentation, code implementation, and datasets used in the analysis.
Below, you'll find an overview of the structure and content of the repository.

#### **Repository Structure**
Each folder represents a distinct project and contains the following:  

1. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Each notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the project, including:  
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
     - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insights  
     - Development and evaluation of predictive models (where applicable)  

2. **CSV Dataset**  
   - A dataset specific to the project, used for the analysis and modeling.
   - Each dataset is stored in the `.csv` format for ease of access and reuse.  

3. **Folder-Specific README**  
   - Each folder has a dedicated `README.md` providing:  
     - An overview of the project  
     - How to access and interpret the files  
     - The aims and objectives of the analysis  

#### **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Install libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and statsmodels as required by the specific project.  

2. **Usage:**  
   - Navigate to the folder of interest.  
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook file to follow the analysis and modeling steps.  
   - Refer to the folder-specific `README.md` for detailed project objectives and instructions.

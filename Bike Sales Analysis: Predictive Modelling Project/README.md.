### **Bike Sales Analysis and Predictive Model Development**

This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation related to analyzing bike sales data and building a predictive model to forecast bike prices. 
Below, you'll find details about the contents of this folder and the purpose of the project.

#### **Contents of the Folder**

1. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   - Filename: `Bike_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`  
     This notebook contains a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and the development of a predictive model to estimate bike prices.
     Key steps include: 0 
     - Data cleaning and preparation  
     - Statistical analysis and insights  
     - Building and evaluating a machine learning model  

2. **CSV Dataset**
   - Filename: Bike_Sales_Data.csv
     Description:
   - This file contains the dataset used for the analysis and model development. It includes detailed information about bike sales such as pricing, features, and other relevant factors

#### **Project Objectives**
- Perform an in-depth analysis of bike sales data to uncover trends and insights.  
- Develop a predictive model capable of estimating bike prices based on the dataset.  
- Provide actionable insights to stakeholders for better decision-making in the bike sales domain.  

#### **Getting Started**
1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Install required libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.  

2. **How to Use:**  
  - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Bike_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) to view the analysis and model-building steps.  
  - Use the CSV file (`Bike_Sales_Data.csv`) for data reference or reuse in further analyses.
